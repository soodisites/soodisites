# 🌐 soodi592 Websites

Hi👋 I'm [soodi592](https://github.com/soodi592) and I made this account because i felt that if I created my sites in my own account, my account would become messy and cluttered.
So I decided to create a separate account so that my sites wouldn't interfere with my other projects.
